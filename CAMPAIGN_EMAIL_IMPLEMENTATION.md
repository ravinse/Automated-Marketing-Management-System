# Campaign Email Execution - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented automatic email and SMS sending functionality for marketing campaigns. When a campaign is approved or reaches its scheduled start time, emails and SMS are automatically sent to all segmented customers using the campaign's title and content.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Campaign Scheduler (`backend/utils/campaignScheduler.js`)

#### Added Functions:
- **`executeCampaignAutomatically(campaign)`**
  - Automatically sends emails and SMS to targeted customers
  - Uses campaign's `emailSubject` and `emailContent` for emails
  - Uses campaign's `smsContent` for SMS messages
  - Updates campaign performance metrics
  - Logs detailed execution information

- **`checkAndStartScheduledCampaigns()`**
  - Checks for approved campaigns that have reached their start date
  - Automatically changes status to 'running'
  - Executes the campaign immediately
  - Runs every 5 minutes via scheduler

- **`runScheduledChecks()`**
  - Combined function that runs both scheduled campaign checks
  - Checks for campaigns to start
  - Checks for campaigns to complete

#### Updated:
- Modified `startCampaignScheduler()` to call `runScheduledChecks()` instead of just checking expired campaigns
- Added exports for new functions

### 2. Updated Campaign Controller (`backend/controllers/campaignController.js`)

#### Modified `approveCampaign()`:
- Now checks if campaign should start immediately (start date is today or past)
- If immediate: 
  - Sets status to 'running'
  - Executes campaign automatically
  - Returns execution results
- If scheduled for future:
  - Sets status to 'approved'
  - Will be executed by scheduler when start date arrives

#### Enhanced `executeCampaign()`:
- Added detailed console logging for debugging
- Explicitly uses campaign's `emailSubject` for email titles
- Explicitly uses campaign's `emailContent` for email bodies
- Explicitly uses campaign's `smsContent` for SMS messages
- Improved success/failure tracking

### 3. Email Service (`backend/utils/emailService.js`)
- Already properly configured
- Uses `emailSubject` parameter as email title
- Uses `emailContent` parameter as email body
- Supports HTML email formatting
- Includes batch sending with rate limiting

### 4. SMS Service (`backend/utils/smsService.js`)
- Already properly configured
- Uses `smsContent` for SMS messages
- Supports batch sending
- Includes mock mode for testing
- Ready for Twilio integration

### 5. Campaign Model (`backend/models/Campaign.js`)
- Already has all required fields:
  - `emailSubject` - Used as email title
  - `emailContent` - Used as email body
  - `smsContent` - Used as SMS message
  - `customerSegments` - For targeting
  - `targetedCustomerIds` - For targeting
  - `performanceMetrics` - For tracking

### 6. Test Script (`backend/test-campaign-execution.js`)
Created comprehensive test script that:
- Creates test customers with segments
- Creates a test campaign with proper content
- Executes the campaign
- Shows detailed results
- Can be run with: `node backend/test-campaign-execution.js`

### 7. Documentation (`CAMPAIGN_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`)
Created complete guide covering:
- How automatic execution works
- Campaign execution process
- API endpoints
- Configuration requirements
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting tips
- Best practices

## How It Works

### Workflow:

1. **Campaign Creation**
   - Marketing team creates campaign with:
     - Email subject (title)
     - Email content (body)
     - SMS content
     - Customer segments or IDs
     - Start/end dates

2. **Campaign Approval**
   - Marketing manager approves campaign
   - System checks start date:
     - **If start date ≤ now**: Execute immediately
     - **If start date > now**: Schedule for later

3. **Automatic Execution** (when approved or scheduled)
   - Fetch all customers matching segments
   - Send emails using `campaign.emailSubject` and `campaign.emailContent`
   - Send SMS using `campaign.smsContent`
   - Update performance metrics

4. **Scheduler** (runs every 5 minutes)
   - Start approved campaigns that reached start date
   - Complete running campaigns that passed end date

## API Endpoints

### Execute Campaign Manually
```bash
POST /api/campaigns/execute/:id
```

### Approve Campaign (Auto-Execute)
```bash
PATCH /api/campaigns/approve/:id
```

## Configuration Required

### Email Setup (`.env`):
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Marketing System
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
```

### SMS Setup (Optional - `.env`):
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-account-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your-twilio-number
```

## Testing

### Run Test Script:
```bash
cd backend
node test-campaign-execution.js
```

This will:
1. Create 3 test customers (2 Premium, 1 Regular)
2. Create a test campaign targeting Premium segment
3. Execute the campaign
4. Show detailed results

### Test with Real Email:
1. Configure EMAIL_* variables in `.env`
2. Create customers with real email addresses
3. Create and approve a campaign
4. Check email inbox

## Console Logs

When a campaign is executed, you'll see:
```
🚀 Auto-executing campaign: Premium Customer Flash Sale (ID: 67...)
📧 Found 2 customers for campaign execution
✉️ Emails sent: 2/2
📱 SMS sent: 2/2
✅ Campaign executed successfully: Premium Customer Flash Sale
```

When scheduler runs:
```
🔄 Running scheduled campaign checks...
▶️ Started campaign: Summer Sale (ID: 67...)
🚀 Auto-executing campaign: Summer Sale (ID: 67...)
✓ Successfully started and executed 1 scheduled campaigns
```

## Key Features

✅ Automatic execution on approval (if start date is today/past)
✅ Scheduled execution for future campaigns
✅ Emails use campaign title (`emailSubject`)
✅ Emails use campaign body (`emailContent`)
✅ SMS uses campaign content (`smsContent`)
✅ Segments customers properly
✅ Updates performance metrics
✅ Detailed logging for debugging
✅ Error handling and validation
✅ Batch sending with rate limiting
✅ Automatic campaign completion when end date passes

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend/utils/campaignScheduler.js` - Enhanced with auto-execution
2. ✅ `backend/controllers/campaignController.js` - Updated approval and execution logic
3. ✅ `backend/test-campaign-execution.js` - New test script
4. ✅ `CAMPAIGN_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation

## Files Already Configured (No Changes Needed)

1. ✅ `backend/utils/emailService.js` - Already working correctly
2. ✅ `backend/utils/smsService.js` - Already working correctly
3. ✅ `backend/models/Campaign.js` - Has all required fields
4. ✅ `backend/models/Customer.js` - Has segment field
5. ✅ `backend/index.js` - Scheduler already started
6. ✅ `backend/routes/campaigns.js` - Routes already defined

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Email Service**
   - Add EMAIL_* variables to `.env`
   - Test with a real email address

2. **Test the Functionality**
   - Run the test script: `node backend/test-campaign-execution.js`
   - Or manually test via API

3. **Optional: Configure SMS**
   - Set up Twilio account
   - Add TWILIO_* variables to `.env`
   - Uncomment Twilio code in `smsService.js`

4. **Monitor in Production**
   - Check console logs regularly
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Review campaign execution results

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending?
- Check EMAIL_* variables in `.env`
- Verify SMTP credentials
- Check console logs for errors
- Test with `verifyEmailConfig()` function

### Campaign Not Executing?
- Verify campaign status is 'approved' or 'running'
- Check that emailSubject/emailContent are set
- Confirm customers exist in targeted segments
- Review console logs

### No Customers Found?
- Verify segment names match exactly
- Check customer records have proper segment field
- Confirm targetedCustomerIds or customerSegments are set

## Success Criteria

✅ Campaigns execute automatically when approved (if start date is now/past)
✅ Campaigns execute automatically when start date arrives (via scheduler)
✅ Emails use campaign's `emailSubject` as title
✅ Emails use campaign's `emailContent` as body
✅ SMS uses campaign's `smsContent`
✅ Customers are properly segmented
✅ Performance metrics are updated
✅ Detailed logging is available
✅ Test script validates functionality

## Performance Metrics Tracked

After execution, campaigns will have:
- `sent`: Total messages sent (emails + SMS)
- `delivered`: Successfully delivered messages
- `opened`: Email opens (can be tracked later)
- `clicked`: Link clicks (can be tracked later)
- `conversions`: Conversions (can be tracked later)
- `revenue`: Revenue generated (can be tracked later)

**Implementation Complete! ✅**

The system now automatically sends emails and SMS to segmented customers when campaigns are executed, using the campaign's title (emailSubject) and body (emailContent/smsContent).
