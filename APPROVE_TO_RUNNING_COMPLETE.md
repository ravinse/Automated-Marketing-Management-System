# Approve to Running - Implementation Complete! âœ…

## Summary

When a marketing manager **approves** a campaign from the Pending Approval table, it now **automatically goes to Running status** and appears in:
- âœ… Running table on `/thome` page (Team Member)  
- âœ… Running table on `/campaign` page (Marketing Manager)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend - Auto-Start on Approval
**File:** `backend/controllers/campaignController.js`

```javascript
// OLD: campaign.status = 'approved';
// NEW: campaign.status = 'running';
```

**Result:** Approve button now directly starts the campaign!

### 2. Frontend - Running Tables Updated
- âœ… `frontend/src/team member/Running.jsx` - Fetches running campaigns dynamically
- âœ… `frontend/src/Tables/Running.jsx` - Manager view of running campaigns
- âœ… `frontend/src/team member/Home.jsx` - Dashboard counts updated

---

## Complete Workflow

```
1. Team Member submits campaign
   â†“
   status: 'pending_approval'
   â†“
   Appears in: Sent for Approval (team) & Pending Approval (manager)

2. Manager clicks "Approve"
   â†“
   status: 'running' (automatically!)
   â†“
   Appears in: Running table (/thome & /campaign) âœ…

3. Campaign runs until end date
   â†“
   Auto-completes when end date passes
   â†“
   status: 'completed'
   â†“
   Appears in: Finished/Completed tables
```

---

## Testing

### Quick Test:
1. Go to `/campaign` page
2. Find a campaign in "Pending Approval"
3. Click "Approve"
4. **Check Running tables** - campaign should appear!
   - Team Member: `/thome` â†’ Click "Running" card
   - Manager: `/campaign` â†’ "Running Campaigns" section
