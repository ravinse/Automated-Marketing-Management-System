# Backend Is Working! - Quick Fix Guide

## 🔴 Problem
You said "backend not working" - but it **IS working**! You just need to restart it.

## ✅ Quick Solution (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Start Backend Server
Open Terminal 1 and run:
```powershell
cd backend
node index.js
```

**Keep this terminal open!** You should see:
```
📅 Campaign scheduler started - checking every 5 minutes
🚀 Server running on port 5001
MongoDB Connected: ...
```

### Step 2: Test It Works
Open Terminal 2 (NEW terminal) and run:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:5001/
```

You should see: `"Backend API is running..."`

## ✅ Or Use the Scripts

### Option A: Start Backend (Terminal 1)
```powershell
.\start-backend.ps1
```

### Option B: Test Backend (Terminal 2)
```powershell
.\test-backend.ps1
```

## 🎯 What Was Wrong?

The backend server was started **BEFORE** you added the new code for:
- Starting campaigns (approved → running)
- Completing campaigns (running → completed)
- Automatic scheduler

**Solution:** Just restart the server to load the new code!

## 🧪 Test the New Features

### Get Running Campaigns
```powershell
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/campaigns?status=running"
```

### Get Completed Campaigns
```powershell
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/campaigns?status=completed"
```

### Start an Approved Campaign
```powershell
# First, get an approved campaign ID
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/campaigns?status=approved"

# Then start it (replace CAMPAIGN_ID)
$body = '{}' 
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5001/api/campaigns/start/CAMPAIGN_ID" -Method PATCH -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Note:** Campaign needs `startDate` and `endDate` to be started!
