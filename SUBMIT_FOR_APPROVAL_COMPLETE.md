# Submit for Approval System - Complete Implementation ✅

## Overview
Team members can now submit campaigns for approval, and these campaigns will appear in:
1. **Team Member Dashboard** (`/thome`) → "Sent for Approval" table
2. **Marketing Manager/Campaign Page** → "Pending Approval" table

When you press "Submit for Approval", the campaign saves to the database with status `pending_approval` and appears in both locations.
