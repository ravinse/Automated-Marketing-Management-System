# Approved Campaigns Feature - Documentation

## 📋 Overview

Added an **"Approved" campaigns section** for Marketing Managers to view and manage campaigns that have been approved by owners but not yet executed.

## ✨ What Was Added

### New Component: `/frontend/src/Tables/Approved.jsx`

A complete table component that displays approved campaigns with:
- **Campaign Details**: Name, description, target segments
- **Target Count**: Number of customers to be reached
- **Schedule Information**: Start and end dates
- **Approval Date**: When the campaign was approved
- **Status Badge**: Visual indicator (Ready, Scheduled, Ready to Start)
- **Execute Button**: Starts campaign execution (sends emails/SMS)
- **View Button**: View full campaign details

### Updated Component: `/frontend/src/Marketingmanager/Campaign.jsx`

- Added "Approved" tab to the campaign navigation
- Tab order: `Pending Approval → Approved → Running → Completed`
- Integrated the Approved component into the tab system

## 🎯 Features

### 1. **View Approved Campaigns**
- Shows all campaigns with `status: 'approved'`
- Clean, professional table layout

- **Campaign Name & Description** (truncated if too long)
- **Target Segments** (displayed as badges, max 2 shown + count)

### 3. **Status Badges**
Three dynamic status indicators:
- 🔵 **Scheduled**: Start date is in the future
- 🟢 **Ready to Start**: Start date has passed

### 4. **Execute Campaign**
- **Execute Button**: Triggers campaign execution
- Confirmation dialog before execution
- Calls backend API: `POST /api/campaigns/execute/:id`
- Sends emails/SMS to all targeted customers
- Campaign moves to "Running" status after execution

### 5. **View Campaign Details**
- **View Button**: Opens campaign review page
- Route: `/campaignreview?campaignId={id}`
- Shows complete campaign information

### 6. **Empty State**
When no approved campaigns exist:
- Friendly empty state with icon

- Helpful subtitle

### 7. **Info Panel**
Bottom information panel explains:
- What approved campaigns are
- How to execute them
- What happens when executed

## 📊 UI/UX Features
