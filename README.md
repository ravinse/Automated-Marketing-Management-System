## 🔄 Workflow

### Campaign Creation & Approval Process

```
1. Team Member creates campaign
   ↓
2. Campaign submitted for review
   ↓
3. Marketing Manager reviews
   ↓
   ├─→ Approved → Campaign goes live → Can be executed
   │
   └─→ Rejected → Team Member receives feedback
              ↓
              Team Member edits and resubmits
              ↓
              Back to step 3
```

### Campaign Execution Flow

```
1. Approved campaign ready for execution
   ↓
2. Manager triggers campaign execution
   ↓
3. System filters customers by segment
   ↓
4. Automated emails/SMS sent to targeted customers
   ↓
5. Campaign metrics tracked in real-time
   ↓
6. Campaign auto-completes on end date
   ↓
7. Owner reviews performance analytics
```

## 🤖 Machine Learning Features

The system includes intelligent customer segmentation powered by machine learning:

### RFM Analysis
- **Recency**: How recently did the customer make a purchase?
- **Frequency**: How often do they purchase?
- **Monetary**: How much do they spend?

### Segmentation Algorithm
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. RFM score calculation
3. K-Means clustering for customer grouping
4. Segment profiling and labeling
5. JSON export for campaign targeting

### Usage
```python
# From ml directory
python data_cleaning.py

# Output: Customer segments exported to JSON
# Automatically integrated with backend API
```

## 🚂 Railway Deployment

### Quick Start

Deploy your application to Railway without crashes! We've optimized the backend to work perfectly with Railway's infrastructure.

**📚 Comprehensive Guides:**
- **[RAILWAY_FIX_SUMMARY.md](RAILWAY_FIX_SUMMARY.md)** - Overview of the deployment solution
- **[RAILWAY_CHECKLIST.md](RAILWAY_CHECKLIST.md)** - Step-by-step deployment checklist
- **[RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md](RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Detailed deployment guide
- **[RAILWAY_ARCHITECTURE.md](RAILWAY_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Architecture diagrams and explanations
- **[RAILWAY_QUICK_START.md](RAILWAY_QUICK_START.md)** - Quick reference

### The Problem (Fixed!)

The backend was crashing on Railway due to internal schedulers running every minute. This has been **completely fixed** by using Railway's Cron Jobs instead.

### Key Changes

✅ **Environment Variable Control** - `ENABLE_SCHEDULERS` to control internal schedulers  
✅ **Cron API Endpoints** - New `/api/cron/*` endpoints for scheduled tasks  
✅ **Railway Cron Jobs** - External scheduling instead of internal timers  
✅ **Improved Stability** - No more crashes from background processes  
✅ **Better Resource Usage** - Optimized for Railway's platform  

### Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Set environment variables in Railway:**
   ```env
   ENABLE_SCHEDULERS=false
   CRON_SECRET=your_secure_random_string
   # ... other required variables
   ```

2. **Deploy backend service** (will be stable now!)

3. **Set up Railway Cron Job** to call:
   ```
   GET https://your-backend.railway.app/api/cron/all?secret=YOUR_CRON_SECRET
   ```
   Every 5 minutes: `*/5 * * * *`

4. **Done!** Your application will run stably without crashes.

### Testing

```bash
# Test cron endpoint
curl "https://your-backend.railway.app/api/cron/health"

# Trigger scheduled tasks manually
curl "https://your-backend.railway.app/api/cron/all?secret=YOUR_SECRET"
```
