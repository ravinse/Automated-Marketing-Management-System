# Campaign Execution Fix - Documentation

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### Error Message
```
Failed to execute campaign: Error executing campaign
```

### Root Cause
The campaign execution function (`executeCampaign` in `campaignController.js`) was trying to fetch customer data from the **Mongoose `Customer` model**, but the actual customer data (with emails and phone numbers) exists in the **MongoDB Atlas `newdatabase` collection** accessed via **MongoClient**.

### Why It Failed
```javascript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN)
customers = await Customer.find({
  _id: { $in: campaign.targetedCustomerIds }
});
// This returns empty because Customer model doesn't have the actual customer data
```

Your system architecture:
- **Customer segmentation data**: `retail_db.customer_segmentation` collection
- **Customer contact info** (email, phone): `retail_db.newdatabase` collection
- **Mongoose Customer model**: Separate collection, not used for actual customer data

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added MongoClient Import
```javascript
// File: backend/controllers/campaignController.js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
```

#### 2. Updated `executeCampaign` Function
Replaced the customer fetching logic to use MongoClient and query the `newdatabase` collection:

```javascript
// NEW CODE (WORKING)
const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGO_URI || process.env.MONGODB_URI;
const DATABASE_NAME = process.env.SEGMENTATION_DB || 'retail_db';
const ORDERS_COLLECTION = process.env.ORDERS_COLLECTION || 'newdatabase';

mongoClient = new MongoClient(MONGODB_URI);
await mongoClient.connect();
const db = mongoClient.db(DATABASE_NAME);
const ordersCollection = db.collection(ORDERS_COLLECTION);

// Fetch customers from orders collection
const customerData = await ordersCollection.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { customer_id: { $in: campaign.targetedCustomerIds } }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$customer_id",
      customer_name: { $first: "$customer_name" },
      email: { $first: "$email" },
      phone_number: { $first: "$phone_number" },
      gender: { $first: "$gender" }
    }
  }
]).toArray();
```

#### 3. Added Proper Cleanup
```javascript
finally {
  if (mongoClient) {
    await mongoClient.close();
  }
}
```

#### 4. Enhanced Error Logging
```javascript
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error executing campaign:', error);
  console.error('Error details:', error.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ message: "Error executing campaign", error: error.message });
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Campaign Execution Flow

```
1. Fetch campaign from MongoDB
   ↓
2. Validate campaign status (must be 'approved' or 'running')
   ↓
3. Validate campaign has email/SMS content
   ↓
4. Connect to segmentation database (retail_db)
   ↓
5. Fetch customer data from 'newdatabase' collection
   - Uses campaign.targetedCustomerIds
   - Aggregates to get: email, phone_number, customer_name
   ↓
6. Send emails (if emailSubject and emailContent exist)
   ↓
7. Send SMS (if smsContent exists)
   ↓
8. Update campaign performance metrics
   ↓
9. Change campaign status to 'running'
   ↓
10. Close database connection
```

### Data Sources

| Data | Location | Access Method |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Campaign Info | `main_db.campaigns` | Mongoose (Campaign model) |
| Customer IDs | `campaign.targetedCustomerIds` | Stored in campaign |
| Customer Emails/Phones | `retail_db.newdatabase` | MongoClient aggregation |
| Segmentation Data | `retail_db.customer_segmentation` | MongoClient |

## 📋 Requirements

### Campaign Must Have
1. ✅ `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'running'`
2. ✅ `emailSubject` and `emailContent` OR `smsContent`
3. ✅ `targetedCustomerIds` array with customer IDs
4. ✅ Customers must exist in `newdatabase` collection

### Customer Data Must Include
- `customer_id`: Unique identifier
- `email`: Valid email address (for email campaigns)
- `phone_number`: Valid phone number (for SMS campaigns)
- `customer_name`: Customer's name

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script Created
`backend/test-campaign-execution-fix.js`

Run with:
```bash
cd backend
node test-campaign-execution-fix.js
```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create a campaign**:
   - Login as Team Member or Manager
   - Create campaign with customer segments
   - Ensure customers are selected and IDs are saved

2. **Submit for approval**:
   - Submit campaign
   - Login as Owner
   - Approve the campaign

3. **Execute campaign**:
   - Login as Manager
   - Go to Campaigns → Approved tab
   - Click "Execute" on approved campaign
   - Confirm execution

4. **Verify success**:
   - Check for success message
   - Campaign should move to "Running" tab
   - Check backend logs for email/SMS sending

### Expected Backend Logs

```
📧 Executing campaign: Spring Sale 2025
📧 Email Subject: Special Offer - Spring Sale!
📧 Targeting 150 customers
📧 Sending emails with subject: "Special Offer - Spring Sale!"
✉️ Emails sent: 150/150
✅ Campaign "Spring Sale 2025" executed successfully!
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Campaign has no targeted customers"

**Cause**: `campaign.targetedCustomerIds` is empty or undefined

**Solution**: 
- Recreate the campaign ensuring customers are properly selected
- Check that the campaign save includes `targetedCustomerIds`
- Verify customer segmentation is working

### Issue 2: "No customers found for this campaign"

**Cause**: Customer IDs don't exist in `newdatabase` collection

**Solution**:
- Verify customer IDs exist: Run `node test-customer-string-id.js`
- Check customer ID format (e.g., "CUS80000" not 80000)
- Ensure auto-segmentation has run

### Issue 3: "Campaign must have either email subject/content or SMS content"

**Cause**: Campaign has no content

**Solution**:
- Edit campaign and add email subject/content
- Or add SMS content
- Resubmit for approval

### Issue 4: MongoClient connection error

**Cause**: Database connection issues

**Solution**:
- Check `.env` file has correct `MONGO_URI`
- Verify MongoDB Atlas connection
- Check network/firewall settings

## 📊 Validation Checks

The function now validates:

1. ✅ Campaign exists
2. ✅ Campaign status is 'approved' or 'running'
3. ✅ Campaign has email OR SMS content
4. ✅ Campaign has targeted customer IDs
5. ✅ Customers exist in database
6. ✅ Customers have email (for email campaigns)
7. ✅ Customers have phone (for SMS campaigns)
