# Auto-Save Campaign Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented auto-save functionality for the Campaign Creation form that automatically saves draft data to MongoDB when users move between form sections.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Campaign Model (`backend/models/Campaign.js`)
Created a comprehensive schema with:
- **Basic Info**: title, description, createdBy
- **Targeting**: startDate, endDate, selectedFilters, customerSegments
- **Content**: emailSubject, emailContent, smsContent, attachments
- **Status Management**: 
  - Status enum: `draft`, `pending_approval`, `approved`, `running`, `completed`, `rejected`
  - currentStep tracking: `basic`, `targeting`, `content`, `template`
- **Timestamps**: Automatic createdAt and updatedAt fields

### 2. Campaign Controller (`backend/controllers/campaignController.js`)
Implemented 8 controller methods:
- `getCampaigns()` - Fetch all campaigns with filtering
- `getCampaignById()` - Get single campaign details
- `createCampaign()` - Create new campaign
- **`autoSaveCampaign()`** - **KEY METHOD** for auto-save functionality
  - Creates new campaign if ID is 'new'
  - Updates only provided fields (partial update)
  - Returns campaign ID for tracking
- `updateCampaign()` - Full campaign update
- `submitCampaign()` - Submit for approval
- `approveCampaign()` - Approve campaign
- `deleteCampaign()` - Delete campaign

### 3. Campaign Routes (`backend/routes/campaigns.js`)
RESTful API endpoints:
- `GET /api/campaigns` - List all campaigns
- `GET /api/campaigns/:id` - Get campaign details
- `POST /api/campaigns` - Create new campaign
- **`PATCH /api/campaigns/:id/autosave`** - **Auto-save endpoint**
- `PUT /api/campaigns/:id` - Full update
- `PATCH /api/campaigns/:id/submit` - Submit for approval
- `PATCH /api/campaigns/:id/approve` - Approve campaign
- `DELETE /api/campaigns/:id` - Delete campaign

## Frontend Implementation

### Campaign Creation Component (`frontend/src/pages/CampaignCreation.jsx`)

#### State Management
Added four new state variables:
```javascript
const [campaignId, setCampaignId] = useState(null);      // Track saved campaign ID
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState('basic');  // Track form section
const [autoSaving, setAutoSaving] = useState(false);      // Show saving indicator
```

#### Auto-Save Logic

**1. Debounced Auto-Save on Field Changes:**
```javascript
const triggerAutoSave = () => {
  clearTimeout(autoSaveTimeout);
  autoSaveTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    autoSaveCampaign(formData);
  }, 2000); // Saves 2 seconds after user stops typing
};
```

**2. Auto-Save Function:**
- Calls `POST /api/campaigns` for new campaigns
- Calls `PATCH /api/campaigns/:id/autosave` for existing drafts
- Stores campaign ID after first save
- Shows loading indicator during save
- Logs success/error to console

**3. Section Transition Saves:**
When user focuses on:
- **Targeting section** (Start Date field) â†’ Saves if coming from Basic section
- **Content section** (Email Subject field) â†’ Saves if coming from Targeting section

#### Visual Indicators
- **Top-right corner**: Spinning icon with "Saving..." text
- **Section headers**: "(Saving...)" text during save operations
- **Below title**: "âœ“ Draft saved (ID: xxx)" when campaign is saved

## How It Works

### User Journey:
1. User opens `/campaigncreation` or `/newcampaign`
2. Fills in Campaign Title and Description
3. Every field change triggers auto-save after 2-second delay
4. When user clicks on "Start Date" (targeting section):
   - System detects section transition
   - Immediately saves all data from Basic section
   - Creates new campaign in MongoDB with status "draft"
   - Returns campaign ID and stores it in state
5. User continues filling targeting fields
6. Each change auto-saves with 2-second debounce
7. When user clicks on "Email Subject" (content section):
   - System saves all targeting data
   - Updates campaign in database
8. Process continues for remaining sections

### Data Flow:
```
User Input â†’ handleChange() â†’ triggerAutoSave() 
  â†’ 2s delay â†’ autoSaveCampaign() 
  â†’ API Call (POST/PATCH) â†’ MongoDB 
  â†’ Response with Campaign ID â†’ Update UI
```

## API Endpoints in Use

### POST /api/campaigns
**Purpose**: Create new campaign draft
**Request Body**: Full campaign object
**Response**: 
```json
{
  "message": "Campaign created successfully",
  "campaign": {
    "_id": "...",
    "title": "...",
    "status": "draft",
    ...
  }
}
```

### PATCH /api/campaigns/:id/autosave
**Purpose**: Update existing draft with partial data
**Request Body**: Only changed fields
**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Campaign auto-saved successfully",
  "campaign": {
    "_id": "...",
    ...updated fields...
  }
}
```

## Testing the Feature

### 1. Start the servers:
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm start
# Should show: ðŸš€ Server running on port 5001

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Should show: http://localhost:5180
```

### 2. Test Auto-Save:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5180/newcampaign
2. Type a campaign title (e.g., "Summer Sale Campaign")
3. Wait 2 seconds â†’ Check console for "Campaign auto-saved successfully"
4. Check MongoDB â†’ Should see new document with status "draft"
5. Note the campaign ID displayed under the page title
6. Click on "Start Date" field â†’ Immediate save triggered
7. Fill targeting info â†’ Auto-saves every 2 seconds
8. Click on "Email Subject" â†’ Immediate save triggered

### 3. Verify in MongoDB:
```javascript
// In MongoDB Atlas or Compass
db.campaigns.find({ status: "draft" }).pretty()
```

## Benefits

âœ… **No Data Loss**: All progress is automatically saved
âœ… **User-Friendly**: No manual "Save Draft" button needed
âœ… **Efficient**: Debouncing prevents excessive API calls
âœ… **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicators show save status
âœ… **Resume Work**: Users can return later using campaign ID

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Backend `.env` file:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://yashodakalhara187_db_user:EeNxZVRFzvZC6sld@feedbackcluster.v9m9pp1.mongodb.net/FeedbackDB
PORT=5001
```

Frontend (uses Vite env vars):
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```

## Technical Notes

- **Debounce Delay**: Set to 2000ms (2 seconds) to balance UX and server load
- **Campaign ID**: Stored in state, persists until page reload
- **Status**: All auto-saves use status "draft"
- **Current Step**: Tracks which section user is working on
- **Error Handling**: Errors logged to console (can be enhanced with toast notifications)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Local Storage**: Persist campaign ID in localStorage for page refreshes
2. **Toast Notifications**: Show success/error messages to user
3. **Offline Mode**: Save to localStorage when offline, sync when online
4. **Auto-Resume**: Load last edited draft on component mount
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle multiple users editing same campaign
6. **Version History**: Track changes over time

## Files Modified/Created

- âœ… `backend/models/Campaign.js` (new)
- âœ… `backend/controllers/campaignController.js` (new)
- âœ… `backend/routes/campaigns.js` (new)
