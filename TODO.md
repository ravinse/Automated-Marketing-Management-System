# Manager Page Routing Fix

## Issue: Navbar clicks redirect to login instead of proper pages

### Steps Completed:
1. [x] Fix Manager Navbar Routes in `frontend/src/Navbar/MMnav.jsx`
   - Updated Dashboard link from '/' to '/manager'
   - Updated Campaigns link from '/' to '/manager' (stays on same page)
   - Updated Templates link from '/' to '/manager/templates'
   - Updated Reports link from '/' to '/manager/reports'
   - Updated Audience link from '/' to '/manager/audience'

2. [x] Add Missing Routes in `frontend/src/App.jsx`
   - Added /manager/templates route
   - Added /manager/reports route
   - Added /manager/audience route

3. [x] Update Manager Dashboard Component
   - Modified `MarketingMDash.jsx` to handle different routes
   - Added route-based content rendering
   - Added placeholder sections for Templates, Reports, and Audience

### Steps Completed:
1. [x] Verify Authentication Flow
   - Authentication middleware is properly configured
   - JWT token handling works correctly for all roles including manager
   - No role-based restrictions preventing manager access

2. [x] Test Navigation
   - Both frontend (port 5176) and backend (port 5001) servers are running
   - All navbar links now point to correct routes instead of '/'
   - Manager dashboard properly handles different route sections
   - No more unauthorized redirects to login page

### âœ… ISSUE RESOLVED:
The manager page routing issue has been successfully fixed! Navbar clicks no longer redirect to login.

### Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/Navbar/MMnav.jsx` (main fix - updated navbar routes)
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` (added missing routes)
- `frontend/src/manager/MarketingMDash.jsx` (added route-based rendering)
