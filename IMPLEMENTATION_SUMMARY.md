# Customer Segmentation 14-Day Filter - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Changes Completed

All changes have been successfully implemented to filter "New Customers" based on **14 days** instead of 6 months, and adapted to work with your MongoDB Atlas `newdatabase` structure.

## 📊 Your Database Structure

### Database: `newdatabase`
- **orders** collection - Contains order history with `order_date` field
- **customer_segmentation** collection - Contains customer segments

### Key Integration:
The system now queries the `orders` collection to find customers with purchases in the last 14 days, then filters the `customer_segmentation` collection accordingly.

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Backend:
1. **`backend/controllers/segmentationController.js`**
   - Updated `getFilteredCustomers()` to query orders by `order_date`
   - Updated `previewCustomerCount()` with date-based filtering
   - Enriches customer data with email, phone, and order details from orders collection
   - Changed database name to `newdatabase`

2. **`backend/.env`**
   - Added `SEGMENTATION_DB=newdatabase`
   - Added `SEGMENTATION_COLLECTION=customer_segmentation`

3. **`backend/.env.example`**
   - Added segmentation database configuration examples

### Frontend:
1. **`frontend/src/Marketingmanager/CreatecampaingM.jsx`**
   - Added `daysPeriod: 14` to API calls
   - Updated console logging

2. **`frontend/src/team member/CreatecampaingT.jsx`**
   - Added `daysPeriod: 14` to API calls
   - Updated console logging

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Data Date Issue:
Your sample order data shows:
```json
"order_date": "2024-01-15T00:00:00.000+00:00"
```

This is from **January 2024** (over 600 days old). With a **14-day filter**, this means:

- ❌ **0 customers** will be returned for "New Customers" 
- ✅ **Other segments** (Loyal, Lapsed, High Value, etc.) will work fine

### Solutions:

#### Option 1: Test with Recent Orders
Add some test orders with recent dates to your `orders` collection:
```javascript
db.orders.insertMany([
  {
    order_id: "ORD99991",
    customer_id: "CUST0001",
    customer_name: "Nimal Rajapakse",
    email: "nimal.rajapakse0001@gmail.com",
    phone_number: "706439873",
    order_date: new Date(), // Today
    product_category: "Men",
    total_amount_lkr: 5000
  },
  {
    order_id: "ORD99992",
    customer_id: "CUST0002",
    customer_name: "Test Customer",
    email: "test@example.com",
    phone_number: "771234567",
    order_date: new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 7 days ago
    product_category: "Women",
    total_amount_lkr: 3000
  }
])
```

#### Option 2: Increase Day Period
Change from 14 days to a longer period that includes your data:

**In `CreatecampaingM.jsx` and `CreatecampaingT.jsx`:**
```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({ 
  customerSegments: segments,
  daysPeriod: 365 // Use 365 days (1 year) or 600 days to include 2024 data
})
```

#### Option 3: Use Other Segments for Testing
Test with segments that don't depend on dates:
- ✅ "Loyal Customers"
- ✅ "Lapsed Customers"
- ✅ "High value customers"
- ✅ "Medium Value"
- ✅ Product categories (Men, Women, Kids)

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Restart Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

You should see in the logs:
```
Server is running on port 5001
MongoDB connected...
```

### 2. Restart Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Campaign Creation:

#### Test A: With Other Segments (Will Work)
1. Go to Campaign Creation page
2. Select segments: "Lapsed Customers" or "Medium Value"
3. Should see customer count displayed
4. ✅ Success!

#### Test B: With New Customers (Will Show 0 Unless You Have Recent Orders)
1. Select "New Customers" segment
2. Expected: 0 customers (because orders are from 2024)
3. Console log: "Found 0 customers with orders in last 14 days"

#### Test C: After Adding Recent Test Orders
1. Add test orders (see Option 1 above)
2. Select "New Customers" segment
3. Should see the test customers
4. ✅ Success!

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check MongoDB Connection:
```bash
cd backend
node -e "console.log('MONGO_URI:', process.env.MONGO_URI); console.log('DB:', process.env.SEGMENTATION_DB)"
```

### Check Recent Orders:
In MongoDB Atlas, run:
```javascript
// Count total orders
db.orders.countDocuments()

// Count recent orders (last 14 days)
db.orders.countDocuments({
  order_date: {
    $gte: new Date(new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() - 14))
  }
})

// Count orders from last year
db.orders.countDocuments({
  order_date: {
    $gte: new Date(new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() - 365))
  }
})
```

### Check Customer Segments:
```javascript
// Count by segment type
db.customer_segmentation.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: {
        frequency: "$segmentation.purchase_frequency",
        spending: "$segmentation.spending",
        category: "$segmentation.category"
      },
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  },
  { $sort: { count: -1 } }
])
```

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. ✅ Restart backend and frontend servers
2. ✅ Test with "Lapsed Customers" or other segments
3. ✅ Verify customer count displays correctly

### For Full Testing:
1. 📝 Add test orders with recent dates (see Option 1)
2. 🔍 Test "New Customers" filter with recent data
3. 📊 Verify email and phone data appears correctly

### Optional:
1. 🔧 Adjust `daysPeriod` to match your data range
2. 🎨 Add UI dropdown to let users choose the period
3. 📈 Add date range display in customer preview

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Backend won't start
**Check:** 
- MongoDB Atlas connection string in `.env`
- Network access whitelist in MongoDB Atlas
- Database name is `newdatabase`

### Issue: 0 customers for all segments
**Check:**
- MongoDB has data in `customer_segmentation` collection
- Run: `db.customer_segmentation.countDocuments()` in Atlas

### Issue: 0 customers for "New Customers" only
**Expected!** Your orders are from 2024, which is older than 14 days.
**Solution:** Use Option 1 or Option 2 above

### Issue: Missing email/phone in customer list
**Check:**
- `orders` collection has `email` and `phone_number` fields
- Customer IDs match between collections
