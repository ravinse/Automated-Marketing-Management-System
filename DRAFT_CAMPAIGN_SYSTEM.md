# Draft Campaign System - Complete Implementation ✅

## Overview
Team members can now save campaigns as drafts and view them on the `/thome` dashboard. When you press the "Save as Draft" button, the campaign saves to the database and appears in the Drafted table.

## Button Differences

### Three Action Buttons:

   - Clears all form data
   - Does not save
   - Stays on same page

2. Save as Draft (Dark Gray)
   - Saves to database with status 'draft'
   - Redirects to /thome
   - Can edit later

3. Submit for Approval (Blue)
   - Saves to database with status 'pending_approval'
   - Sends to manager for approval
   - Appears in Pending Approval table
```

## Dashboard Integration

### Home Dashboard (`/thome`)

**Four Status Cards**:
1. **Drafted** - Campaigns saved as draft
2. **Sent for Approval** - Pending manager approval
3. **Running** - Active campaigns
4. **Finished** - Completed campaigns

**Features**:
- ✅ Real-time counts from database
- ✅ Click card to view campaigns
- ✅ Color-coded cards
- ✅ Auto-refresh on section change

**Counts Update Automatically**:
- When you save a draft → Drafted count increases
- When you submit for approval → Sent for Approval count increases
- Counts are fetched from database on page load

---

## Files Updated

### 1. **createcampaingT.jsx** (Campaign Creation)

**Changes**:
- ✅ Updated `handleSaveAsDraft()` function
  - Now saves to database
  - Sets status to 'draft'
  - Redirects to `/thome`
  - Shows success message

- ✅ Updated buttons section
  - Changed "Drafted" button to "Save as Draft"
  - Changed button type to `button` (prevents form submit)
  - Changed color to gray (`bg-gray-600`)
  - Added `onClick={handleSaveAsDraft}`

**Key Function**:
```javascript
const handleSaveAsDraft = async () => {
  // Validate title
  if (!formData.title.trim()) {
    alert('Campaign title is required');
    return;
  }

  // Save or update campaign
  if (!campaignId) {
    // Create new draft
    POST /api/campaigns
    body: { ...formData, status: 'draft' }
  } else {
    // Update existing draft
    PATCH /api/campaigns/autosave/:id
    body: { ...formData, status: 'draft' }
  }

  // Redirect to home
  navigate('/thome');
};
```

---

### 2. **Drafted.jsx** (Drafted Campaigns Table)

**Complete Rewrite**:
- **Before**: Static hardcoded data
- **Now**: Fetches from database dynamically

**Features Added**:
- ✅ `fetchDraftedCampaigns()` - Fetches campaigns with status 'draft'
- ✅ `handleDelete()` - Deletes draft from database
- ✅ Loading state while fetching
- ✅ Error state if fetch fails
- ✅ Empty state if no drafts
- ✅ Edit button with campaign ID in URL
- ✅ Delete button with confirmation
- ✅ Real-time data display
- ✅ Automatic count in header

**Key Features**:
```javascript
// Fetch only draft campaigns
const drafts = campaigns.filter(c => c.status === 'draft');

// Edit link with campaign ID
<Link to={`/createcampaingt?campaignId=${campaign._id}`}>
  Edit
</Link>

// Delete with confirmation
const handleDelete = async (campaignId) => {
  if (confirm('Delete?')) {
    await DELETE /api/campaigns/:id
    fetchDraftedCampaigns(); // Refresh
  }
};
```

---

### 3. **Home.jsx** (Dashboard)

**Updates**:
- ✅ Added `useEffect` to fetch campaign counts
- ✅ Added `fetchCampaignCounts()` function
- ✅ Added `campaignCounts` state
- ✅ Dynamic counts in cards
- ✅ Refetch counts when section changes

**Key Changes**:
```javascript
const [campaignCounts, setCampaignCounts] = useState({
  drafted: 0,
  sentForApproval: 0,
  running: 0,
  finished: 0
});

useEffect(() => {
  fetchCampaignCounts();
}, [activeSection]);

const fetchCampaignCounts = async () => {
  const campaigns = await fetch('/api/campaigns');
  
  const counts = {
    drafted: campaigns.filter(c => c.status === 'draft').length,
    sentForApproval: campaigns.filter(c => c.status === 'pending_approval').length,
    running: campaigns.filter(c => c.status === 'approved').length,
    finished: campaigns.filter(c => c.status === 'completed').length
  };
  
  setCampaignCounts(counts);
};
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Draft not saving?
**Check**:
1. ✅ Campaign title is filled (required)
2. ✅ Backend running on port 5001
3. ✅ Frontend running on port 5176
4. ✅ MongoDB connected

**Test API**:
```powershell
# Create draft
$body = @{
    title = "Test Draft"
    status = "draft"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5001/api/campaigns" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

---

### Drafted table empty?
**Check**:
1. ✅ Saved campaigns with status 'draft'
2. ✅ API returns campaigns
3. ✅ Filter is working correctly

**Test**:
```powershell
# Get all campaigns
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5001/api/campaigns" -Method GET | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
```

---

### Count not updating?
**Reason**: Counts fetch on page load and section change

**Fix**: 
- Refresh page after saving draft
- Or click another card then click Drafted again

---

### Edit not loading data?
**Check**:
1. ✅ Campaign ID in URL is correct
2. ✅ createcampaingT.jsx supports campaignId parameter
3. ✅ Add loading logic for edit mode

**Current**: Edit link includes campaign ID but you may need to add loading logic to createcampaingT.jsx

---
