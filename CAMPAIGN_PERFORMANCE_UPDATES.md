### Utility Files

#### Seed Script (`backend/seedCampaignMetrics.js`)
- Seeds the database with sample campaign performance data
- Creates 5 sample completed campaigns if none exist
- Adds random realistic metrics to existing completed campaigns
- Useful for testing and demonstration

## How to Use

### 1. Set Up Performance Data

Run the seed script to add sample performance metrics:

```bash
cd backend
node seedCampaignMetrics.js
```

This will either:
- Create 5 sample completed campaigns with performance data, OR
- Add performance metrics to your existing completed campaigns

### 2. Start the Application

Make sure both backend and frontend are running:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. View Performance Data

1. Navigate to the Campaign Performance page (Owner Dashboard â†’ Campaign Performance)
2. View the overall performance summary at the top showing aggregate metrics
3. Use the dropdown to select a specific completed campaign
4. View detailed metrics for the selected campaign
5. Scroll down to see all completed campaigns in a table format
6. Click "View" on any campaign in the table to see its details

### 4. Update Performance Metrics (via API)

To update metrics for a campaign programmatically:

```javascript
// Update campaign metrics
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/campaigns/{campaignId}/metrics', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    performanceMetrics: {
      sent: 5000,
      delivered: 4850,
      opened: 1250,
      clicked: 250,
      conversions: 100,
      revenue: 15000
    }
  })
});
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add date range filtering for performance data
2. Export performance reports to PDF/Excel
3. Add charts and visualizations (line charts, pie charts)
4. Compare multiple campaigns side-by-side
5. Add email delivery status tracking
6. Real-time performance updates
7. Performance trends over time
8. A/B testing results comparison

## Notes

- All rates are calculated as percentages with 2 decimal places
- Revenue is displayed in USD currency format
- Dates are formatted in a user-friendly format (e.g., "Sep 15, 2024")
- The component handles loading and error states gracefully
- Performance data is fetched from the API when the component mounts
- The seed script adds realistic random data for testing purposes
